# Running feature record

## Step 1 — Admissions dashboard shell

Status: implemented on a feature branch; awaiting user review before merging into dev.

- Choose multiple study destinations and subjects, plus a degree level and target intake.
- View matching fictional programs and select one to see its admission stages.
- See examples of fixed dates, unpublished dates and deadlines relative to an offer.
- Understand that applicant category is unconfirmed and separate from study destination.
- Use the dashboard with keyboard navigation or on a narrow screen.
- All displayed information is sample data. There is no live collection or API use.

The controls, program cards and admission stages use shared components for consistency.

Skill assessment: this small dashboard shell does not yet justify a dedicated reusable skill. Proposed decision, pending user confirmation: keep its guidance in project documentation. Reconsider reusable discovery and verification skills in later steps.

## Add your own countries and subjects

Status: implemented on a separate feature branch; awaiting user review before merging into dev.

- Add a country or subject using its New field and Add button, or press Enter.
- A new option is selected immediately; click Find programs to apply the selection.
- Names are trimmed and repeated spaces removed. Blank names and duplicates ignoring letter case are rejected.
- Added options are saved in this browser. If storage is blocked, they remain available for the current session and a message explains that limitation.
- After reloading, added options remain available but selection returns to the default settings.
- Adding options does not discover programs or create sample deadlines. This remains a sample dashboard without APIs.

Skill assessment: the shared add-option component belongs in this project; no separate skill is recommended. Awaiting confirmation of this assessment.
